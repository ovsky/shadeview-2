## 🌟 Features

- **🔍 Syntax Highlighting**:  
  Robust syntax highlighting for HLSL and GLSL, making it easier to read and navigate shader code. It highlights language-specific keywords, types, functions, and more.

- **💡 Autocomplete**:  
  Intelligent code completion for HLSL and GLSL built right into VSCode. Get suggestions for language constructs and shader functions, reducing time spent on remembering function names and syntax.

- **📜 Code Snippets**:  
  Quickly insert common shader code snippets, such as function templates for vertex and fragment shaders, matrix transformations, or texture sampling, to accelerate shader development.

- **📚 Built-In Shaders Documentation**:  
  Press `F12` to view definitions or right-click and select **Go to Definition** to explore how elements work!

- **❗ Error Highlighting**:  
  Real-time error detection and linting for HLSL and GLSL code, ensuring you catch issues before compilation, with detailed error messages.

- **🔧 Debugging Support**:  
  Integrated debugging features like stepping through code, inspecting variables, and viewing real-time outputs.

- **🌍 Cross-Platform Support**:  
  Fully compatible with both Windows and macOS for HLSL and GLSL development, with plans for Linux support in future versions.

- **⚙️ Customizable Settings**:  
  Tailor the plugin’s features to your preferences, including adjusting syntax highlighting, customizing linting rules, or setting up custom snippets.

## 🛠️ Work In Progress (WIP)

- **🔮 Integrated In-Editor Unity GLSL/HLSL Shader Preview**:
- Test your shader code directly within Visual Studio Code with an integrated GLSL and HLSL compiler, ensuring your shaders are valid and ready for your graphics pipeline!
