# 🌈 ShadeView - Complete Shader Support for Visual Studio Code

---

## ✨ Description

**ShadeView 2** for Visual Studio Code provides the first-ever comprehensive support for writing **HLSL** (High-Level Shading Language) and **GLSL** (OpenGL Shading Language), along with **ShaderLab** and **Compute Shaders** in the **VSC IDE**. Designed specifically for graphics engineers and developers working with shaders, especially in Unity or Godot - but it also works with every engine you choose!
The plugin enhances your workflow by bringing advanced features for these languages directly into **Visual Studio Code** and/or your favorite **VSC-based** code editor and game engine.

> Shader Realtime Preview Feature [Available in Preview Version - WIP]

---

- **🔍 Syntax Highlighting**:  
  Robust syntax highlighting for HLSL,GLSL and Compute Shaders, making it easier to read and navigate shader code. It highlights language-specific keywords, types, functions, and more.

- **💡 Autocomplete**:  
  Intelligent code completion for HLSL, GLSL and Compute Shaders built right into VSCode. Get suggestions for language constructs and shader functions, reducing time spent on remembering function names and syntax.

- **📜 Code Snippets**:  
  Quickly insert common shader code snippets, such as function templates for vertex and fragment shaders, matrix transformations, or texture sampling, to accelerate shader development.

- **📚 Built-In Shaders Documentation**:  
  Just `hover your mouse over a keyword` and you'll see _exactly what it does_!
  However, if it's an engine method - press `F12` to see the definition or if it is complicated one, right-click and select **Go to Definition** to see clearly how the method works!

- **❗ Error Highlighting**:  
  Real-time error detection and linting for HLSL, GLSL and Compute Shader code, ensuring you catch issues before compilation, with detailed error messages.

- **🔧 Debugging Support**:  
  Integrated debugging features like stepping through code, inspecting variables, and viewing real-time outputs.

- **🌍 Cross-Platform Support**:  
  Fully compatible with both Windows and MacOS for HLSL, GLSL and Compute development, with partial or full support for Linux - depending on which distribution you use.

- **⚙️ Customizable Settings**:  
  Customize the plugin's features to your preferences, including adjusting syntax highlighting, customizing linting rules, or setting up custom code snippets and more.

## 🛠️ Work In Progress (WIP)

- **🔮 Shader Realtime Preview - Integrated Multi-Language Feature**:
- Test your shader code directly within Visual Studio Code with an integrated GLSL and HLSL compiler, ensuring your shaders are valid and ready for your graphics pipeline!

## 😸🫂😸 Cooperation:

_For me, the best payment for a ton of hard work and a long months of development of a **ShadeView 2** would be just people, wanting to help with its development! Just like with the first version - I'm counting on you, people! :)_

**ShadeView 2 - Source Code**: [GitHub Repository: ShadeView 2](https://github.com/ovsky/shadeview-2.0)

You ***do NOT NEED to know programming*** in Node/JS/TS or even any shader language, to support the development! 

#### DEVELOPERS:
Above all, if youre programmer, you can help by developing translation system HLSL/GLSL (Unity) > Three.JS, which can be found: `.\extensionn\out\src\ShaderRenderer.js`. Alternatively if you are not interested in Unity, you can find your way by adding support for other game engines or frameworks! It is one of my biggest goals for **ShadeView 2** or **3**, to be fully universal. *Eventually, you can suggest better way to render shaders in VSC than clumsy translating code into Three.JS, if you have :)*

#### HELPERS:
Even *if you do not know much about coding*, or you just do not code in JS/TS, you can help by expanding the shaders documentation JSONs in: `extension\out\src\data`. For example, like finding and adding an any omited by me Shader keyword/function/value/type and entering description of it- *yes it's as simple as it sounds!* - for example, you can find something in Unity or Vulkan documentation, like - for example - `_WorldSpaceCameraPos` and you can simply add found information, that it is: World-Space relative position of the Camera, represented by `float3` :)

*Example:*
````
"_WorldSpaceCameraPos": {
"type": "float3",
"documentation": "World-Space position of the Camera."
},
````

I would be extremely grateful and any help would be rewarded - maybe not financially, due to the non-profit nature of the project, but by being recognized as one of the co-authors of the **ShadeView 2**!

Many people suggested to create ShadeView Development Discord, if you think it is a great idea, please tell me by this archaic, e-mail, way! :)
Thanks in advance!

*FYI complete ShadeView 2 documentation will be available soon :)*
